### <i> "Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist." - Pablo Picasso </i>

## Welcome! I'm Ronan, 

My skillset is derived from a unique background of programming, UI/UX design, and music. Drawing from my background as a songwriter, recording artist, and performer, I've cultivated a unique perspective on creativity that informs my approach to problem-solving and coding.

Presently, I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at University College Dublin, where I balance technical acumen, problem-solving, and effective teamwork. With a focus on Python and frontend development, I'm always on the lookout for challenging projects that deepen my understanding of coding, design, and creative thinking.

## üé∏ The Melodious Coder 

Music informs my coding perspective, letting me see rhythm in lines of code, harmony in user-friendly design, and melody in efficient algorithms. What I love about music is it brings me into a meditative 'flow' state when things are working just right. This is'nt much different when coding either!

## üé® Crafting Digital Experiences

Equally compelling to me is the world of design. With an eye for aesthetics and user engagement, I've embarked on the journey of mastering UI/UX design. Creating intuitive interfaces and shaping seamless user experiences are challenges that fuel my passion and creativity every day. 

## üë®‚Äçüíª Passion for Programming 

As a programmer, I'm continuously seeking to deepen my understanding of various aspects of the tech stack. I am always up for challenges that push my limits, instigating me to come up with robust, efficient solutions. My goal is to craft software that doesn't just function effectively but also resonates with the users at an aesthetic and experiential level.

## üîó Highlight Projects:

-['NYSeeNow'](https://github.com/Fei117117/NYSeeNow):An innovative summer project with a diverse team of six. 'NYSeeNow' is a real-time, interactive travel itinerary guide, created to predict 'busyness' levels at various attractions. As the Customer Lead within the front-end team, I led the UI design and wireframing, bringing the user experience to life with React.js and Node.js. The backend is powered by Java/Springboot and Python/Flask, ensuring a robust and responsive data management. I also harnessed the power of Amazon EC2 for reliable and scalable hosting. On the design side, I enjoyed the creative process of crafting custom graphics and logos that bring a unique aesthetic appeal to our platform. The culmination of these technologies and efforts has resulted in a comprehensive, user-friendly guide for efficient travel planning.


-['Dublin Bikes Finder'](https://github.com/finbarallan/Dublin-Bikes-App): A location-based web app built with Python to help users find the nearest Dublin Bikes Stations and chart their route using real-time data from a MySQL database.


-['Java Asteroids Game'](https://github.com/mattx245/Java-Asteroids-Game):  An interactive JavaFX game crafted in a team of five. In this project, I had the opportunity to extensively develop the UFO objects, curate the game-over screen, and create an immersive user interface. I integrated custom-designed cartoon character images for the main screen, contributing to the game's unique aesthetic. 

## üë• Additional Projects:

- Web Development: Developed two data visualization websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
- MySQL Database: Created a relational database for a hospital using MySQL Workbench.
- Software Engineering: Authored an A-grade SRS document and developed a web application using Python.
- Python OOP: Developed a text-based RPG game.
- Data Structures: Conducted performance tests for various algorithms, including factorial and search, using Python in Jupyter notebook.
- Data Analytics: Utilized Python for predictive analysis in COVID-19 research.
- Operating Systems: Developed VM programs in C.

## üéº Personal Interests:
